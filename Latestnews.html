                <p>Now that video games have well and truly entered the mainstream we find ourselves at a time where there is a game for every conceivable genre and to appeal to every kind of player.

                    In general, this is a fantastic thing. It means chances are no matter what you’re after, there’s a game out there for you. That said, for all the fantastical mediaeval adventures, engaging hero shooters, and everything in between, there have inevitably been a handful of games that certain people think went too far.
                    
                    Perhaps this was a government laying down a ban on a game for being too violent, a subsect of gamers declaring the game inappropriate for its themes, or dedicated fans with expectations who were so let down by a title they walked away from it immediately and deemed it unplayable.
                    
                    Whatever the case may be in each of these cases, somebody wasn’t happy with the following titles.</p>
